	"description": "Welcome to Create, a mod offering a variety of tools and blocks for Building, Decoration and Aesthetic Automation.\nThe added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible, where item processing doesn't happen inside a single block with funny textures, it requires a set of actors working together in many possible arrangements.\nCheck out the wiki and in-game Tool-tips for further info on how to use these features, and stay tuned for an ever-growing selection of possibilities for Creative and Survival Minecraft.\nDespite it being marked as Release here on CurseForge, The Create Project is officially considered in beta and subject to change until version 1.0 releases.\nImportant: In order to be able to see all recipes and processing types added by Create, consider installing JEI. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.",
